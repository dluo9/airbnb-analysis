# airbnb-analysis
This is an analysis of data that's been pulled from Kaggle. It contains information about Airbnb hostings in New York Cities.


The goal of this is to see what kind of interesting trends and models can be built. It is currently a work in progress, but check in soon if interested in seeing more.

Thanks!
